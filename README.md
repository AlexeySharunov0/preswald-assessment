# Iris Data Analysis App

This project is a simple data analysis application built using the Preswald platform. It demonstrates the ability to work with real-world datasets, perform data filtering, and create interactive visualizations with a minimal data-driven UI.

## Project Overview

The app loads the classic Iris dataset and allows users to interactively filter the data based on sepal length. It then visualizes the filtered data using a scatter plot of sepal length vs sepal width, colored by species.

## Why Iris Dataset?

The Iris dataset was chosen because it is a well-known, clean, and simple dataset that is ideal for demonstrating data analysis and visualization techniques. Its clear structure and distinct classes make it perfect for building interactive filtering and plotting features within a limited timeframe.

## Technologies Used

- **Preswald SDK**: Used to build the Python-backed data app with UI components such as sliders, tables, and plotly visualizations. Preswald enables composing end-user facing applications with minimal code.
- **Pandas**: For data loading and manipulation, including filtering the dataset based on user input.
- **Plotly Express**: For creating interactive and visually appealing scatter plots.
- **Streamlit**: (Initially used in development) for rapid prototyping of the UI and data visualization.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for data processing and app logic.

## Branding Customization

A custom logo has been added to the project to showcase the ability to personalize the app's branding. This demonstrates familiarity with customizing the app's appearance beyond just functionality, enhancing the user experience.

## About the Challenge

This project was developed as part of the Structured Labs Online Assessment for Preswald. The goal was to:

- Work with real-world datasets
- Perform data cleaning and SQL-like queries
- Build minimal data-driven UIs
- Use SDKs to compose end-user facing applications

The challenge encouraged creativity, thoughtfulness, and learning new tools within a limited timeframe.

## How to Run

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (see `requirements.txt`).
2. Run the app using the Preswald platform or locally with the appropriate environment.
3. Use the interactive slider to filter the Iris dataset by sepal length and explore the visualization.
